# Luna ðŸŒ˜

A collection of utilities an helpers for doing stuff in the browser with JavaScript.

## Usage

Install using a specific commit hash; eg

```
npm install https://github.com/dominicwhittle/luna#commitsha
```

Both TypeScript and JavaScript are included, with the JavaScript versions in the `dist` directory.

In your scripts:

`import { addClass } from "luna/dom/class"` or `import { addClass } from "luna/dist/dom/class" for the TypeScript and Javascript versions respectively.

You will likely want to use a bundler like browserify, es-build, webpack etc to build your code for use in the browser.


## Development

You'll need to install:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (I install this globally)

Build:

```
nvm use
yarn build # note demos not built here, see yarn demos
```

Watch: `nvm use` then separate terminal windows for `yarn watch`, `yarn demos`, and `yarn serve`.


### Bundling notes

For specific browser targetting you might want to try something like:

```
npx esbuild example/script.ts --bundle --minify --sourcemap --target=chrome58,firefox57,safari11,edge79 --outfile=example/script.bundle.js
```
